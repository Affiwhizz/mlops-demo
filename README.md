# MLOps Demo â€” Pandas Mini-Project  

This repository is part of my Ironhack bootcamp work, where I explored Pandas fundamentals while structuring the project in an **MLOps-style workflow**.  
It includes lab exercises, the `Admission_Predict.csv` dataset, and supporting Python scripts.  

## Quickstart  

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Affiwhizz/mlops-demo.git
   cd mlops-demo
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script

bash
Copy code
python src/ml_ops.py
Features
Creates a Pandas Series and demonstrates indexing.

Builds a small DataFrame and performs column/row operations.

Loads data/Admission_Predict.csv and prints simple stats/filters.

Notes
Python 3.10+ recommended.

Dataset is for teaching/demo only.

This repo reflects my learning journey with Pandas and Git/GitHub workflows. Feel free to fork or suggest improvements.
